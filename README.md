# GoldBadgeChallenges 

### Challenges 1, 5 & 6

## Introduction: 
The aim of this project was to test my grasp on C# and the ability to make a database for certain prompts using the CRUD method of C-Creating, R-Reading, U-Updating, & D-Deleting. 
Each prompt required a class, but had properties that were differing in nature. This project was also testing my ability to understand Object Oriented Programming.
